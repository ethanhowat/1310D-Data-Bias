3,If Ollie or others think that one list of the oldest people we know about is too long the easy answer is to raise the cutoff age 110 is purely a round number and a full 12 years shorter then the record We can make it the top 1000 or top 500 or everyone above 115  tell us what the maximum list size is and we can set a threshold,0.014011159
4,  balance  This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word and a huge amount about the slangprofane uses Perhaps the former should be extended is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name This is an encyclopaedia not a dictionary     i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipediaIMMEDIATLY this word is used very often and is also a very mean word i belive that is majorly true very much so okay so the good meaning is a female dog  BITCH It also stands for the name Brittany Fellows—Preceding unsigned comment added by   •     etymology  The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning female of the dog of unknown origin Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja But OED notes that the converse is equally possible  The adj Bitchy was first seen in 1925   The verb meaning to complain in 1930  Slang Bitchen good is attested to the 1950s   reclaiming the word bitch   The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English In most other English variants bitch maintains its correct definition  female canine People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult  but so is pig dog cow and others These are not considered profane so why is bitch As far as I am concerned there is nothing to reclaim as bitch simply means a female canine  It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor  that does not make it a profanity      It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women reclaiming the word bitch in the 90s Can anyone point to articles on this etc The song is definitely interesting and belongs here but doesnt actually reclaim the word bitch any more than it reclaims the word sinner  Also I dont really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up but I realized I dont know what it means Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches fertility and patriarchy more clearly   We dont need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples even outside of the 90s Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word for instance Shes a Bitch    References are fine  just the name Missy Elliot got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned reclaiming the word In fact if some one knows more about her it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to womenslurs more generally within hiphop    How relevant is this reclamation It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits I dont see how using a word connoting querolous spiteful and malicious can be empowering But I dont know lifes a bitch    It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesnt adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch To use a literary example in the novel The Handmaids Tale the narrator related the feeling that whenever she outsmarted a man she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind even her own husband     That literary reaction you recited is jealousy men have names for other men who outsmart them too but not having a word like bitch for them they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets Though you havent been specific I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination which both sexes often strive to impose on the other but men have traditionally had more power Because it is such a popular epithet in slang the connotations of bitch are diffuse though still commonly pernicious I think bitch in itself is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard but rather a contemptuous word often used for it  However I still dont see the point of reclamati,0.20009702

6,I agree with Billfruge The author describes the unverifiable nature of the two competing etymology theories sufficiently well so as not to mislead any reader renders an opinion as to which of the two is more likely and it is clear that this is the authors opinion and presents the reader with the opportunity to accept either or neither of the two,0.017089844
7,  There are now four references including Britannica giving the correct date which is getting silly You complain in your edit summary that you cant find them so Ive added quotes to two to help you out After that youre on your own WPSOURCEACCESS has more on this Im happy to concede that Britannica alone mentions the date you offer but without explaining the context so thats one of the sources Ive expanded with a quote specifically mentioning 23 August   Russian Wikipedia has 23 августа силы 14го танкового корпуса армии Паулюса вышли к Волге севернее Сталинграда  August 23 forces of the 14th Tank Corps Army of Paulus reached the Volga north of Stalingrad cited from the war diary of ColonelGeneral Franz Haider     ,0.1991664

13,  Firstly still making undiffable edits and refusing to use edit summaries is becoming a behavioural issue that will need to be escalated if it doesnt stop Gun I really dont understand why you find it so hard to follow the basic standards of behaviour required to edit in a collaborative environment  Secondly announcing changes on someones talk page doesnt really count as discussing them collaboratively rather it means you discussed it with me  Furthermore I told you to go to the NPOV noticeboard to raise the State University vs University issue if you wanted to discuss the issue which you a failed to do b you removed the disputed tag from the article without a result as I suggested waiting until later c you made yet another diff which contained a large number of other unknown unknowable and undisucssed changes to the article    ,0.24282593
